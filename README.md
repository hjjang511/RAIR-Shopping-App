# RAIR Shopping App

## Introduction
The RAIR Shopping App is a one-stop destination for consumers and business stakeholders for their shopping and business needs. Inspired by the ever-evolving landscape of retail, the application provides a seamless and intuitive shopping experience for customers, offering a diverse range of products through an operational database. Recognizing the importance of informed decision-making, we integrated a powerful business insights section tailored for stakeholders, empowering them with valuable data to make strategic business decisions leveraging an analytical database.

## Data Sources
Our shopping app uses the following data sources:
- **Flipkart Products**: Product information.

## Application Design
The application design consists of two main databases â€“ Operational and Analytical.

- **Operational Database (OLTP)**: Manages customer transactions and updates stock levels.
- **Analytical Database (OLAP)**: Supports data analysis for the Admin portal without impacting operational performance.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

## Operational Database Design
The operational database handles customer-facing functionalities such as browsing products, managing shopping carts, updating addresses, and viewing order history. It ensures data integrity and supports seamless user interactions.

## Analytical Database Design
The analytical database, supported by a separate data warehouse, enables stakeholders to analyze sales trends, customer demographics, and other key metrics without slowing down the operational database.
